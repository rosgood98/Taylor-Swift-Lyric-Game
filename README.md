## Program Description
This program is a lyric guessing game for Taylor Swift songs. All data is based of an excel file containing each lyric. The game first asks users if they would like to select what album the lyrics come from. If yes, the game prompts the user for their album choice, and lists three lyrics from songs within that album, allowing the user to guess the name of the song. If not, the game simply lists three lyrics and allows the user to guess the name of the song. The program terminates after three rounds by listing the users statistics (ie. how many correct, how many incorrect, and the accuracy).
